MAY 26TH, Tuesday Notes
HTML ==> 
    - HyperText Markup Language
What is markup language?
    - Mark up languages are created using tags
    - They are not programming languages, therefore they don't have programming logic.
    - They are for creating better presentation structures for pages
What are tags?
    - Tags act like containers for our HTML data.
    - There are two types of tags
        1- Self closing tags / Unpaired tag
            ex: < tagName />
                <br>
                <hr>
        2- Not self closing tags / Paired tag
            ex: < tagName > CONTENT GOES HERE </ tagName>
            opening tag     -- content -----   closing tag
CSS ==> Stands for Cascading Style Sheets
    - CSS is used to give style to existing HTML Structure
    - CSS canNOT be used by itself.
    - If HTML is considered as the skeleton, CSS is the skin of HTML content
JavaScript ==> 
    - Scripting language: 
    - It gives action/functionality/business logic/calculations to our web page
    - Scripting languages does NOT require compiler.
Web Elements ==>
    - Everything we see on a webpage is a web element.
    ex: buttons, links, images, input boxes, texts, headers
Title ==> 
    - Title is not displayed on the page itself
    - It is displayed on the TAB of the browser
    - Title is also important because when you search something on a search engines (such as Google), title is what comes up on the page
strong -> makes text bolded
    ex: <strong> text here is bolded </strong>
u -> makes text/content underlined
    ex: <u> text here is underlined </u>
em -> makes text emphasized. 
    ex: <em> text here is emphasized/italic </em>
hr -> stands for horizontal ruler
    -creates horizontal line to separate sections on a web page
br -> stands for 'line break'
    - basically used to push content to next line or create gaps in between contents
ATTRIBUTES ==> 
    - Attributes provide further information about the webelement/tag
    - Attributes goes into the opening tag of the web element.
    ex#1 for paired tags:
    syntax: <tagname attributeName="attributeValue"> content goes here </tagName>
            <h2 color="red"> this is my header text </h2>
            color   : is attribute name
            red     : is attribute value
    ex#2: 
            <h3 style="color:lightgray">My Fruit List:</h3>
            h3      = tagName/webElement
            style   = attribute NAME
            color:lightgray = attribute VALUE
 
img ==> tag is used to add images on HTML pages
    - requires src attribute value to be added in the tag
    syntax: <img src="path of the image">
HOW TO GET PATH OF THE FILES/IMAGES?
- There are two types of paths
    1- Relative Path : 
    - If the file is in the same directory we can pass the name.extension of the file as the relative path
    - Creating a custom path for our file is relative path.
    EX: if the image is in the same folder as our HTML document, we can pass jus the name of image and extension
        <img src="image.jpg">
    2- Absolute Path : 
    -> Passing the whole path directory from the begining of /Users/username/folder/file.extension
    -> Getting the auto generated path from our computer
    ex : /Users/cybertekchicago-1/Desktop/cybertruck.jpg

        /Users/cybertekchicago-1/Desktop/HTML class/carimage.jpg
a tag ===> also known as ANCHOR TAG
    - <a> tag is used to create links in webpage
    - We can create links to other documents
    - We can create links to other web pages
    - We need to pass two different values
        1- href attribute value: for the link that we want to go
        2- web element TEXT, that will be displayed on the page for the user.
    syntax: 
    <a href="https://www.google.com" >TEXT HERE WILL BE DISPLAYED ON THE PAGE</a>
table --> 
    - <table> tag allows us to create web tables on HTML pages
    - We need create the row first. and then the cells inside each row
    - <tr> -> table row
    - <td> -> table data
    - <th> -> table header
    syntax: 
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>first header</th>
                    <th>second header</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>first cell</td>
                    <td>second cell</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
div --> 
    - <div> tag allows us to create container to group a few elements together
    - div is a block level element, which means it will take the whole line
    - when you create a div and apply any styling to that div, all of the elements inside of that div will be effected. 
span -->
    - <span> is also a container like div.
    - the difference between div and span is, span is NOT a block level element.
    - therefore we can do inline styling using span.
input --> 
    -input tag allows us to created different types of inputs from the user
    <input type="text"> ==> creates text input box
    <input type="password"> ==> creates password input box
    <input type="button" value="button" > ==> creates button
    <input type="checkbox"> ==> creates checkbox
    <input type="radio"> ==> creates radiobuttons
